        <p class="objective">Protien Structure Alignment</p>
        <h1>Theory</h1>
        <p>The first question that comes to mind is that what is protein?
            Proteins are large, complex molecules that play many critical roles in the body. They do most of the work in
            cells and are required for the structure, function, and regulation of the body’s tissues and organs.
            Proteins are made up of hundreds or thousands of smaller units called amino acids, which are attached to one
            another in long chains. There are 20 different types of amino acids that can be combined to make a protein.
            The sequence of amino acids determines each protein’s unique 3-dimensional structure and its specific
            function. Amino acids are coded by combinations of three DNA building blocks (nucleotides), determined by
            the sequence of genes.

        <h2>Protein function examples </h2>
        <p>1.<strong> Antibody</strong>: Antibodies bind to specific foreign particles, such as viruses and bacteria, to help protect the
            body.</p>
        <p>2.   <strong> Enzymes</strong>: Enzymes carry out almost all of the thousands of chemical reactions that take place in cells. They
            also assist with the formation of new molecules by reading the genetic information stored in DNA.</p>
        <p>3.   <strong>Messenger</strong>: Messenger proteins, such as some types of hormones, transmit signals to coordinate biological
            processes between different cells, tissues, and organs.</p>
        <p>4.   <strong>  Structural component</strong>: These proteins provide structure and support for cells. On a larger scale, they also
            allow the body to move.</p>
        <p>5.   <strong> Transport/storage</strong>: These proteins bind and carry atoms and small molecules within cells and throughout the
            body.

            Protein structure
        </h2>
        <P>Protein structure is the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in an amino acid-chain molecule.
            The function of a protein is highly dependent on its 3D structure. The amino acid sequence of a polypeptide
            chain determines the final 3D structure of the protein.
            There are four levels of protein structure; the primary structure, the secondary structure, the tertiary
            structure, and the quaternary structure. Furthermore, there are two main classes of 3D protein structures;
            these are globular and fibrous proteins.
            Complex, 3D proteins are produced by folding of the simple primary and secondary protein structures.

        <h2>
            What is Structure Alignment?

        </h2>
        <P>Structure alignment attempts to establish residue-residue correspondence between two or more macromolecular
            structures based on the optimal superposition of their shape and three-dimensional conformation.
            Structure alignment requires no prior knowledge of equivalent pairs of residues, does not rely on the
            sequence alignment, and the type of residues is ignored when the correspondence is established.
            This tool presents options for pair wise structure alignment of proteins. In the case of pair wise
            alignment, structures are always compared in pairs.
        </P>

        <h2>
            When is Structure Alignment useful?
        </h2>
        <P>Structure alignment is a valuable tool for the comparison of proteins with low structure similarity, where
            evolutionary relationships between proteins cannot be easily detected by standard structure alignment
            techniques. Pair wise protein structure comparison can be used for analysis of conformational changes on
            ligand binding, analysis of structural variation between proteins within an evolutionary family, and
            identification of common structural domains.
        </P>
        <p>There are many ways by which you can perform Protein Structure Alignment like <a href="https://zhanggroup.org/MM-align/">MM align</a>,<a href="https://zhanggroup.org/TM-align/"> TM align</a>,<a href="http://ekhidna2.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali/index.html#tabs-2"> Dali</a>,<a href="http://kpax.loria.fr/"> Kpax</a>, etc. Each of them use different algorithms 
            to align the structures and some are constrained to particular type of structures like TM align only compare the tertiary proteins. So based on your 
            type of structural proteins you can use these tools mentioned above.
